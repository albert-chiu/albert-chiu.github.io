							We introduce Bayesian Rule Set (BRS) as an alternative to Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). BRS is an interpretable machine learning algorithm that classifies observations using rule sets, which are conditions connected by logical operators, eg IF (condition A AND condition B) OR (condition C), THEN Y= TRUE. Like QCA, BRS is highly interpretable and capable of revealing complex nonlinear relationships among explanatory and outcome variables. It has several advantages over QCA. First, as a machine learning algorithm, BRS makes explicit trade-offs between in-sample fitness and model-complexity, thus, it avoids overfitting and improves model interpretability. Second, unlike QCA, BRS tolerates contradictory cases. Third, BRS is scalable and computationally efficient with larger datasets. We tailor BRS to social science settings, quantify its uncertainties, and develop new visualization tools to better present BRS results. Monte Carlo exercises show that BRS outperforms a state-of-the-art QCA algorithm when contradictory cases are present, with this advantage growing with data quantity. We illustrate BRS and new visualization tools using two empirical examples from sociology and political science.

								Since the Civil Rights Movement, scholars have warned that pro-minority policies can create a backlash effect in the majority. Some observers fear these dynamics may be at work in Latin America, where after dramatic advances in LGBT rights, voters have elected anti-gay leaders. To investigate, we created the Latin American Rainbow Index–a measure of LGBT rights in the continent by country–and combined it with individual survey responses to test whether granting new rights had any discernible impact on attitudes. We find no evidence of backlash and little evidence of polarization. We also provide a new index of LGBT rights in the continent, which may be used by other scholars to further examine the LGBT movement in Latin America.

								Public opinion directly affects policy design, as elected officials have an incentive to maintain favor with the electorate in order to win reelections. But can the arrow also point in the opposite direction? We propose that voters, when exposed to policy changes that may favor marginalized groups, are persuaded by policy -- they become more likely to favor civil rights. To test this argument, we collected a unique dataset of eight LGBT rights across 17 Latin American countries, from 1992 to 2016. The study of LGBT rights in this continent is particularly insightful to the analysis of public opinion and policy change because the region has seen an increase in policies favoring LGBT individuals comparable to those in developed countries, while remaining relatively religious and uneducated – variables thought to affect public opinion on LGBT rights. Using public opinion data and a difference in differences design, we are able to show that granting civil rights indeed increases support for same-sex marriage and LGBT candidates running for office, but that this effect is only significant for those with high levels of education. Our identification strategy also includes an estimate of the time lag between policy implementation and public opinion response. We find that this association peaks two years after the policy is enacted. Furthermore, changes promoted by legislatures and the courts had the most effect on support to LGBT issues. Finally, We find no evidence of backlash. In fact, granting gay rights decreases polarization. Our results indicate that public opinion can respond to policy changes, with consequences to how political scientists think of the association between office holders and the public, as well as the avenues available to civil rights activists trying to enact change.
