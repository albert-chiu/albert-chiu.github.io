	Welcome to my website! I'm a PhD student at Stanford's Department of Political Science.
	The goal of my research is to produce, adapt, and apply statistical
	and machine learning methods for social scientific purposes.
	My substantive interests include global health and development,
	authoritarian and mixed regimes, and regime change.
